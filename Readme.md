---

# ⚡ Redis Caching (IMPORTANT)

### ✅ Implemented For:

- Public products route

### 🔁 Flow:

1. Check if data exists in Redis
2. If yes → return cached data
3. If no → fetch from DB → store in Redis → return response

---

## 🔄 Cache Invalidation Strategy

Cache is **automatically cleared** when:

- Product price is updated
- Product stock is updated
- Product is deleted
- Product is activated/deactivated

👉 Ensures **fresh and consistent data**

---

# 🧾 Order Routes (`/order`)

## 🔹 Customer Routes

| Method | Endpoint              | Description     |
| ------ | --------------------- | --------------- |
| POST   | `/order/createOrders` | Create order    |
| GET    | `/order/getOrder`     | Get user orders |

---

## 🔹 Order Items

| Method | Endpoint                          | Description                   |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| POST   | `/order/orderItems/:orderId`      | Add single item               |
| POST   | `/order/orderItems/bulk/:orderId` | 🔥 Add multiple items at once |
| GET    | `/order/orderItems/:orderId`      | Get order items               |
| PUT    | `/order/orderItems/:orderItemId`  | Update quantity               |
| DELETE | `/order/orderItems/:orderItemId`  | Delete item                   |

---

## 🔹 Admin Order Controls

| Method | Endpoint                            | Description               |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| PATCH  | `/order/admin/orderStatus/:orderId` | Update order status       |
| GET    | `/order/order/:userId`              | Get user orders           |
| GET    | `/order/admin/:orderId`             | Get all items of an order |

---

# 🔥 Bulk Order Items Feature

### Endpoint:

```bash
POST /order/orderItems/bulk/:orderId
```

### Description:

- Allows adding **multiple products in a single request**
- Reduces API calls
- Improves performance

### Example Request:

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "product_id": "id1", "quantity": 2 },
    { "product_id": "id2", "quantity": 1 }
  ]
}
```

---

# 🧠 Advanced Business Logic

## ✅ Data Consistency Handling

When:

- Product price changes
- Product stock changes
- Product is deleted

👉 Then:

- Related **order totals are recalculated**
- Dependent data is updated accordingly

---

## ✅ Example Logic

- If product price increases → order total increases
- If product deleted → remove from order → update total
- If quantity updated → total recalculated

---

# 🧠 Database Design

### Relationships:

- **Users → Orders** (One-to-Many)
- **Orders → Order Items** (One-to-Many)
- **Products → Order Items** (One-to-Many)

---

# 🔐 Roles & Permissions

| Role     | Permissions           |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| Customer | Manage orders & items |
| Vendor   | Manage own products   |
| Admin    | Full system control   |

---
